This is a web app I'm making to aid in the play of Wanderhome, a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) by Jay
Dragon. It is a No Dice, No Masters/Belonging Outside Belonging game, a fairly recent design ethos for TTRPG's,
and thus I've struggled to find many play aids tuned specifically for online play. As my group is fully online,
I figured I'd make my own tool for us to use. If I can find the time, I'm hoping to develop this tool out such
that users can add custom playbooks, traits, etc. The API can be found [here](https://github.com/DeadpanCakes/wanderhome_site).

This tool is not designed to just let anyone play the game. Rather, I wanted an easy way to access all the moves
during play. No Dice, No Masters and especially Belonging Outside Belonging games are much more than the sum of
their mechanics, and I can't imagine how one would would wrap their heads around this API without reading
through the PDF first. So, if you don't have Wanderhome yet, you can find it at
[Possum Creek Games'](https://possumcreekgames.com/products/wanderhome-pdf) website. If you're struggling
financially, free community copies occasionally show up on their [itch](https://possumcreekgames.itch.io/wanderhome)
page.

I'm not associated with anyone who worked on this game, this is just a hobby.
